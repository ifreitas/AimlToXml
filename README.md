ScalaAIML
=========

## [AIML](http://www.pandorabots.com/pandora/pics/wallaceaimltutorial.html)
Or Artificial Intelligence Markup Language, is an XML dialect for creating natural language software agents [[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIML)]. AIML is a widely adopted standard for creating chat bots and mobile virtual assistants like [ALICE](http://sheepridge.pandorabots.com/pandora/talk?botid=b69b8d517e345aba&skin=custom_iframe), [Mitsuku](http://www.mitsuku.com/), English Tutor, The Professor, S.U.P.E.R. and many more[[2](https://code.google.com/p/program-ab/)]. 

### AIML Interpreter
- [ProgramD](https://github.com/noelbush/programd) - Program D is the most widely used free ("open source") AIML bot platform in the world. It is the most feature-complete, best-tested implementation of the current AIML specification.
- [ProgramAB](https://code.google.com/p/program-ab/) - Program AB is the reference implementation of the AIML 2.0 draft specification.

### [Loebner Prize](http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html)
The Loebner Prize is an annual competition in artificial intelligence that awards prizes to the chatterbot considered by the judges to be the most human-like. The format of the competition is that of a standard Turing test. In each round, a human judge simultaneously holds textual conversations with a computer program and a human being via computer. Based upon the responses, the judge must decide which is which.

Loebner Prize for "most human computer" AIML [winners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loebner_Prize#Winners):
- [Mitsuku](http://www.mitsuku.com/) (2013, 2016 and 2017)
- [ALICE](http://sheepridge.pandorabots.com/pandora/talk?botid=b69b8d517e345aba&skin=custom_iframe) (2000, 2001 and 2004)
